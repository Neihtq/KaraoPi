<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]
![Product Name Screen Shot][interface-screenshot]

My friends and I often enjoy singing Karaoke at a private place by plugging in some Mics and singing karaoke versions of our favorite songs from YouTube (I call it low budget) - hence the weird project name! 

But project is not all about Karaoke. You can plug some speakers into a computer (e.g. a Raspberry**Pi**) and optionally also a TV as well. The second image shows the web interface where everyone can simply add a video or song or their choice to the queue (via phone and desktop possible).

This application is set in a simple client-server-architecture. Note that the host machine (server) and everyone adding videos to the queue (clients) have to be in the same network!

Everything to know about this project:
* Server: Plays videos from YouTube and provides a queue
* Search Window: (running on host machine): Search for YouTube videos and add them queue; delete queue elements; provides QR code and URL for web interface
* Client (Web interface): Shows queue and currently playing video; search for YouTube videos and them to queue

When having a (karaoke) party/gathering with music running in the background, everyone can add play their videos of choice (but FCFS)-

**tl;dr: remote YouTube player with queue functionality and access via web browser**
